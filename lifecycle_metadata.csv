Annotative Information,"This work builds on the cleaning work done by Radomír Černoch to the dataset originally compiled by Gio Wiederhold. Their work is currently (November, 2022) still available:
Original (Wiederhold): https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Movie
Reformatted (Černoch): https://github.com/cernoch/movies
To prepare this dataset for import into a Neo4j database, additional cleaning / preparation was needed:
-removed remaining historical html formatting artifacts and standardized csv formatting for consistent column import (not all errors were caught, some fields still import into the incorrect column)
-de-duplicated movie ID-movie and director ID-director records
-Typos in the director field of MAIN made this field unsuitable for matching, extracted director code from movie ID for matching
-removed some text field delimiters (e.g.""D:"" for director, ""@"" preceding years (temporal) data)
-split ""directed by"" data out of MAIN, into separate csv for import
-as this was intended to be an exercise in learning Neo4j, and not in analyzing the dataset, not all tables were prepped for import. The following culled tables were not prepped for Neo4j import:
awtypes
keys
locales
quotes
remakes
sayings
studios
synonyms

Remaining tables (as csv files):
actors_clean
casts_clean
directed_by_clean
main_clean
people_clean

There were still some .html formatting artifacts (mostly typos of <td>), or other inconsistencies that caused cells to import into an inconsistent column using the csv files downloaded from Černoch’s repository. I wish I had the technical skills to rectify these problems in reproducible code, unfortunately, my current skill level is not that advanced. Utilizing Numbers’ “find and replace” functionality, I was able to standardize column contents, and remove .html formatting artifacts. Also included in the “data prep” folder are ""ready"" files that were generated using Numbers to remove html formatting artifacts and standardize column contents and the Jupyter Notebooks with the code used for cleaning once the columns were consistent.

Metadata on the remaining fields and their values is located in metadata.csv"

Annotative Information,"This is a dataset of Movies. The original data from the UCI database have been cleaned up and converted from HTML to CSV.
Syntax errors in the original HTML files have been cleaned up.
Script for converting HTML files into CSV was added (see file data/make).
Some additional columns (eg. Ref:) were omitted from the CSV output as they can not be parsed easily by a computer (the HTML files were intact, you can continue working on this easily)."

Annotative Information,"Data Set Information:
The data is stored in relational form across several files. The central file (MAIN) is a list of movies, each with a unique identifier. These identifiers may change in successive versions. The actors (CAST) for those movies are listed with their roles in a distinct file. More information about individual actors (ACTORS) is in a third file. All directors in MAIN are listed in a fourth file (PEOPLE), with a number of important producers, writers, and cinematographers. A fifth file (REMAKES) links movies that were copied to a substantial extent from each other. The sixth file (STUDIOS) provides some information about studios shown in MAIN. 

The original motivation was for database class exercises, to replace the boring `manager of the toy-department' queries. Note that the CASTS, refering MAIN and ACTORS is logically identical to the inventory file refering to suppliers and assemblies in the the standard bill-of-materials problems. Personal interests caused the database to be made complete for all Hitchcock movies and TV episodes. Related films by type and actor were added gradually. 

Subsequent research on temporal databases caused date fields (years only) to be added. It allows testing, say, if the dates-of-work of an ACTOR match the dates of the MAIN films that the CAST relation shows. Object-oriented database features could be tested with fields having multiple and two-level values, as documented in DOC. 

The entries were gradually collected during course work starting about 1975 and are still being updated. Most of the entries were manual. The DOC file lists some of the reference works used. Corrections and additions continue to be appreciated. 

Detailed descriptions of the fields and their formats is provided in doc.html. 

Missing Values: 
Outside of key fields, missing values are common. Their encoding is described in DOC. Sometimes the data seems to be unavailable, sometimes it hasn't been entered. Some information, as `lived-with' is inherently incomplete. 

Censored Data: 
Minor actors are ignored. 

Dependencies: 
Every MAIN film must have a director in PEOPLE. About 50 pseudo director names ahve been listed in PEOPLE to allow interesting films to with (yet) unknown directors to be entered. Every CASTS entry must relate to a MAIN film entry. Every ACTOR should appear in some CASTS entry, but not vice versa. See DOC for more type information. 

Other Relevant Information: 
Films are listed, if known, with their original language title. An Alt(T: ) field provides English translations, where known. 

Data Format: 
The current files are in HTML, to allow easy parsing to other formats. An XML version is being considered. 

The approximate file sizes are: 
DOC ....... 50K 
MAIN ...... 1 145K 11 400 entries 
PEOPLE .... 355K 3 290 entries 
CASTS ..... 4 340K 46 000 entries 
ACTORS .... 811K 6 800 entries 
REMAKES ... 135K 1 278 entries 
STUDIOS ... 26K 200 entries "
